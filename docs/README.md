# KCIF

KCIF is a benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). We adapt existing knowledge benchmarks and augment them with instructions that are a) conditional on correctly answering the knowledge task or b) use the space of candidate options in multiple-choice knowledge-answering tasks. KCIF allows us to study model characteristics, such as their change in performance on the knowledge tasks in the presence of answer-modifying instructions and distractor instructions.
